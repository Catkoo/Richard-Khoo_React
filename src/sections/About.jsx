                    <p>
                        I am Richard Khoo, a magna cumlaude graduate (GPA 3.70) in
                        Informatics Engineering from Sekolah Tinggi Teknologi
                        Indonesia Tanjung Pinang. I specialize in backend development
                        using Node.js, Express.js, and Firebase. As a Bangkit Academy
                        2024 (Cloud Computing Path) alumnus, I contributed to a
                        capstone project by integrating backend systems with cloud
                        infrastructure. I have internship experience, enjoy team
                        collaboration, and am passionate about learning new
                        technologies to solve real-world challenges.
